# Spokane Crime Analysis Project

Spokane Crime Analysis Project (SCAP) is dedicated to discovering, analyzing, and visualizing crime data in Spokane, WA. Informed residents can make better decisions about where to live, raise families, work, and play in our wonderful city with up-to-date information on crime. With data in-hand, residents can engage actively and factually with local leaders and law enforcement. 

## Goals

The Spokane Crime Analysis Project works to meet these goals for the community:

1. Identify and visualize long-term crime trends
1. Discover associations between crime and social, natural, and economic conditions
1. Make meaningful comparisons with cities across the nation
1. Leverage data from diverse, trusted sources
1. Be honest in the use of statistics, models, and estimates
1. Publish objective, independent reports and analysis

## Ongoing Analysis

Crime never stops, unfortunately. To keep track of trends over time we have ongoing analysis sub-projects running on a weekly basis. These track fairly close with data published regularly by the City of Spokane and the County.

## Static Analysis

Older data can give us context for what's happening today. For that reason, we periodically look backward in time with data that won't be updated again. Despite the data being somewhat "stale" it can still give us insight.
