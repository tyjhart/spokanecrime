Spokane is divided into eight police districts, P1 - P8. Most offenses that occur have a district number associated in the data. Some offenses that occur outside a defined district or in an unknown location are marked as Other ("Oth"). Here are the districts:

* P1 - Northwest District
* P2 - Central District
* P3 - Neva-Wood District
* P4 - Northeast District
* P5 - South Central District
* P6 - Southeast District
* P7 - Southwest District
* P8 - Downtown

The Northwest District includes Indian Trail, Five Mile, and some of Five Mile Prarie neighborhoods...
