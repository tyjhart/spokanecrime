# FBI Crime & Population Analysis

*Updated March 22, 2019*

In this project we examine the link between population and crime in Spokane. Both population and crime numbers are provided by [the FBI's UCR Data Tool website](https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Local/JurisbyJuris.cfm). These components make up the analysis:

1. [Data (CSV)](./LocalCrimeJurisbyJuris.csv)
1. [R Markdown](./fbi_ucr.Rmd)

The resulting PDF, showing plots, data tables, and the code that creates them [is available here](./fbi_ucr.pdf) in the *fbi_ucr.pdf* file. Plots are available in PDF and PNG format in the [/figures/](./figures/) directory.
